# Hypergolic Systems (Core)

Hypergolic Systems (HGS) is a _core mod_ for Kerbal Space Program (1.x). As a core mod, it aims to replace significant parts of KSP's core gameplay with new mechanics.

HGS is in active development as of September 2023. The best way to stay in touch with the mod's development is through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gfz3pSJM).

## Roadmap

This section is a work-in-progress.

### Simulation

HGS replaces KSP's simulation of spacecraft systems and mechanics (electricity, fuel, heat, etc) with its own simulation engine. This engine is designed to work not just on the active vessel, but across all spacecraft in the player's universe.

### Electricity

HGS simulates two different electrical systems on a given spacecraft: low-voltage and high-voltage.

The low-voltage system is used for most spacecraft operations: control systems, engine ignition, communications, etc. Every spacecraft has a low-voltage system.

Some more advanced craft have high-voltage systems, which provide power for significant consumers like mining drills, electric engines, power transmitters, etc.
